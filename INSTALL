# ------ Typical installation ------ 

make install # Should work in most cases.


# ------ If that does not work ------
This is is compiled for casa version 4.2.0a rev#28144. If your version is close
to this you should be able to directly used the compiled libraries.  Copy
stacker folder to a python library path, typically "~/.casa/ipython/" is a good
place.

In case the library does not work you will need to manually compile. This requires
casacore of the same version as your casa version uses.

1. Download and compile casacore (v. 1.2.35.29 works for version 4.2.0 of CASA).
2. Add path to casa and casacore in stacked_clib/Makefile
3. $ make
4. $ make install
