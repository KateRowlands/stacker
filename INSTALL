# ------ Typical installation ------ 

make install # Should work in most cases.


# ------ If that does not work ------
This is compiled for several casa versions.  Copy stacker folder to a python
library path, typically "~/.casa/ipython/" is a good place.

In case the library does not work you will need to manually compile. This requires
casacore of the same version as your casa version uses.

1. Download and compile casacore (v. 1.2.35.29 works for version 4.2.0 of CASA).

For version 4.X of casa it should work to run 
$ svn co https://svn.cv.nrao.edu/svn/casa/trunk/casacore/ <destination> -r <your casa version>
to download the right version of casacore headers. And (in "stacker_clib/Makefile") set
CASACORE_INCLUDE=-I$(CASABASE)/include -I<destination>

For version 3.X of casa it should work to set 
CASACORE_INCLUDE=-I$(CASABASE)/include -I$(CASABASE)/include/casacore
in "stacker_clib/Makefile".

2. $ make
3. $ make install
