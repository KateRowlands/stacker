# ------ Typical installation ------ 

make install # Should work in most cases.


# ------ If that does not work ------
This is compiled for several casa versions.  Copy stacker folder to a python
library path, typically "~/.casa/ipython/" is a good place.

In case the library does not work you will need to manually compile. 
This is best done using scons. Typically as:
cd stacker_clib; scons --link2casa; cd ..; make install

# --- Details on compiling from source ---
Build scripts are designed using scons. Requirements:
* scons
* casa or casacore
* pysvn -- Required for most versions of casa, used to download casacore 
           headers for a matching version of casa.
* pkgconfig -- Simplifies the finding of casacore includes and libs when
	           compiling to casacore.


Linking to casa the scons script can be used as follows:
$ scons --link2casa

Linking to casacore 
$ scons
Will use pkgconfig to locate casacore, ensure that casacore.pc or
equivalent is located is PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Several other flags exist to control the compilation and linking:
--casapath: specify an alternate path to casapy
--cuda: Compile cuda support, requires cuda libraries on the system.
        Requires an NVidia GPU to work.


Binding to casa and casacore are not always stable across releases. The
scons script includes code to deal with such changes. Changes are typically
in the location of casacore includes in the casa release.
The script used by scons is located in "SConstruct". Compilation against casa is controlled
against the svnrevision number. This ensures that the script can properly
identify the correct version of casa. For most versions of casa the 
casacore headers are not distributed with the binary release. However,
the headers are in the casa svn repository, as they may not exactly match
the github version of casacore. If modifying "SConstruct" it is recomended 
to add a new clause to "if link_against_casa and int(svnversion) >= 36590:"
if block. Note that code may need to be added in two places. First where
casa headers are downloaded and secondly where they are added to CPPPATH.
